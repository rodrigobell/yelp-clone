# Project 3 - yelp-clone

yelp-clone is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Search for businesses
   - [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
   - [x] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [x] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Search query is saved using User Defaults and app starts with whatever the user searched for last.
- [x] User can call business from Details screen. (Feature cannot be demoed in simulator since it doesn't support calls.)
- [x] Customize UI.
   - [x] Change navigation bar color tint to red.
   - [x] Detail screen background displays blurred thumbnail image of business.
   - [x] Auto Layout implemented in labels and images of details screen.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):
